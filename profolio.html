      <h3>Composite Art,2019</h3>
      <p>It was a group work. I combined group members' images into this image. Grop Name: Panda; The title: Gun control. The background is the night view of Times Square in New York. I think that putting posters in such a crowded place can attract people's attention â€” three posters from our group work. I used a lot of perspective distortions in this project. </p>
