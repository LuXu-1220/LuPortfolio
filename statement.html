  <p>My artworks are all about digital medial art. Including glitch art,composite art,sound art,video art,net art,and code art. The materials that I used are Photoshop, Atom, Github, Vimeo,Soundcloud, and P5. My artworks address that how those materials and technique relates to our medial world.</p>

  <p>The glitch art, sound art, video art, and net art are reflected my daily life. The images that I took during my vacation, the sounds I recorded during the school, the video I recorded from my way to home. The composite art and net art are worked with my classmates. We created really nice artworks together. For my final project, I used Github and Atom to created a video game named Whack-a-mole.
